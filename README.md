# recommendation-system

Using a movie Dataset, I developed an item-to-item (movie-to-movie) recommender system that recommends movies similar to a given input movie. To create the hybrid model, I ensembled the results of an autoencoder which learns content-based movie embeddings from tag data, and a deep entity embedding neural network which learns collaborative-based movie embeddings from ratings data.
